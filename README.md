# Simple SDK

A lightweight JavaScript SDK that adds Simple payment functionality to your web applications. The SDK automatically detects email input fields and adds a payment button next to them.

## Usage

Get started with Simple SDK in just 3 steps:

```html
<!-- 1. Include the Simple script -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@paysimple/simple"></script>

<!-- 2. Add an email input -->
<input type="email" placeholder="Enter email" />

<!-- 3. Configure Simple -->
<script>
  window.applySimpleConfig({
    platformId: "your_platform_id",
    organizationTaxId: "your_organization_tax_id",
    amount: 10.99,
    onSuccess: (response) => console.log("Payment successful!", response),
  });
</script>
```

2. The SDK will automatically:
   - Detect all email input fields on your page
   - Add a Simple payment button next to each email field
   - Handle payment flows through a popup window
